Cursor Agent Test
This project was created to test the functionality of a background agent in Cursor.
The program is a lo-fi web app called “Neprocrastinator”:

lights a candle with smooth animation and sound;

displays a daily Prayer/Mantra and Prediction;

tracks streaks (consecutive days);

generates a PNG image for sharing.

It’s a fully static project that can be deployed via GitHub Pages.
