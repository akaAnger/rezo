Neprocrastinator — Cursor Agent Test

This project was created as an experiment to test the functionality of a background agent in Cursor.
The idea is simple: turn the start of a workday into a small ritual to fight procrastination.

What the app does:

🔥 Candle with animation and sound — a candle appears on the screen with soft flickering, match ignition sound, and melting wax.

🕯️ 10-minute ritual — the candle burns in real-time, creating a focus atmosphere.

📜 Daily Prayer/Mantra — a deterministic phrase is generated to set the mood for work.

🔮 Daily Prediction — a light-hearted, humorous forecast to make the day less boring.

📆 Streak counter — tracks how many days in a row the ritual has been completed.

🖼️ PNG generation for sharing — save the daily ritual as an image and share it with friends or colleagues.

Technical details:

Fully static project (HTML + CSS + JS).

Runs without any backend.

Ready to deploy on GitHub Pages.

Uses WebAudio API for sound and JavaScript animations.

Supports PWA (Progressive Web App) — can be installed like a native app.

Why it matters:

To test and validate Cursor Background Agent capabilities.

To showcase how AI can help build small but atmospheric apps quickly.

To establish a simple work ritual: light a candle → get a phrase of the day → stay focused.
